  In the case of a retailer selling a customer's personal information for profit, multiple systems are damaged in terms of privacy, trust, and security. For instance, the customer database, a technical system that stores customers' sensitive information, is shown to have both poorer privacy and security than customers initially thought. For a business to operate with proper ethics, it must make sure customers can place trust in its databases and other technical systems. However, once it's shown that customer information isn't safe, any trust held within the customer/business relationship is irreparably broken. Unlike the technical system of the customer database, damage to the socio-technical system of the customer/business relationship leads to a poor view of the individuals operating the business more than the underlying technology.
